The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his miet, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (letrillay housemates ), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \" a icezitn of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy \" ). Geneva was John Calvin ' s adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \" Confederate Party \", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an anlclaie between the city - state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Rcuhch) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest pweor in France from the influential House of Guise.

The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple ercindlys and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each.

This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger mebemr states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People ' s Party is yurrlnetc the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti \u00e9cologiste \" Les Verts \" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament ' s powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any ucort proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two - thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 9199 ). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\" kratia \") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\" demos \" ): in the EU it is not yet true that \" the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. \"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}], "question": "Which two governing bodies have legislative veto power?", "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1711, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": 1711, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": 1711, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": 1711, "text": "every five years"}], "question": "How often do Parliament elections take place?", "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbf0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 3114, "text": "the Commission and Council"}, {"answer_start": 3114, "text": "the Commission and Council"}, {"answer_start": 3114, "text": "the Commission and Council"}, {"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}], "question": "What two bodies must the Parliament go through first to pass legislation?", "id": "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbf2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 6, "text": "the Commission"}, {"answer_start": 6, "text": "the Commission"}, {"answer_start": 6, "text": "the Commission"}, {"answer_start": 6, "text": "the Commission"}], "question": "Which entity has a monopoly on initiating legislation?", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e446"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}, {"answer_start": 63, "text": "the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union"}], "question": "Which entities have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process?", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e447"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1196, "text": "1979"}, {"answer_start": 1196, "text": "1979"}, {"answer_start": 1196, "text": "1979"}, {"answer_start": 1196, "text": "1979"}], "question": "When did the first direct elections take place?", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e448"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1711, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": 1711, "text": "every five years"}, {"answer_start": -1, "text": "every five years,"}, {"answer_start": 1711, "text": "every five years"}], "question": "How often do Parliament elections take place?", "id": "5726938af1498d1400e8e449"}]}, {"context": "The second main legislative body is the Council, which is composed of different ministers of the member states.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to lersove conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice ' s view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major scae in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law confcdltie with the Tyerta of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy naianialtsotnoi, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its doicsien.

For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction ), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. \" Regulations, \" held the Court of Justice, \" come into force ellsoy by virtue of their publication \" and implementation could have the effect of \" jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the wolhe of the Union. \" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific eusrl should be followed.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 537, "text": "article 30"}, {"answer_start": 532, "text": "TFEU article 30"}, {"answer_start": 532, "text": "TFEU article 30"}], "question": "Which TEFU article states that no quantitative restrictions can be placed on trade?", "id": "57269bb8708984140094cb96"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 489, "text": "a postal company"}, {"answer_start": 489, "text": "a postal company"}, {"answer_start": 489, "text": "a postal company"}], "question": "What type of company is Van Gend en Loos?", "id": "57269bb8708984140094cb97"}]}, {"context": "While the Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect (if clear, unconditional and immediate ), Dvtceriies do not generally give citizens (as opposed to the member state) standing to sue other citizens.

In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states rrieque more nhta 28 days in atainnol law. However, on the current sopiniot adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves.

So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73 / 173 / EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting tnniolaa law fomr 1963 against Mr Ratti ' s solvent and varnish business. A member state could \" not rely, as against vndiaidlius, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails. \" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Trdeciive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Ngbeial decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not bene notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \" general principle \" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non - state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows rofm K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7 622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Rihtd, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was lnttieed to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \" endgame \" should be the seam as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some ppoeel and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thuogth to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing wlas on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise etohr values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the laneerg aims of the treaty for improvement of people ' s well being.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 84, "text": "2007"}, {"answer_start": 84, "text": "2007"}, {"answer_start": 84, "text": "2007"}], "question": "When was the concept of a social market economy introduced into EU law?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b55"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 176, "text": "1957"}, {"answer_start": 176, "text": "1957"}, {"answer_start": 151, "text": "since the Treaty of Rome 1957"}], "question": "How long has free movement and trade been central to European development?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b56"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 643, "text": "free trade"}, {"answer_start": 643, "text": "free trade"}, {"answer_start": 643, "text": "free trade"}], "question": "What do the Treaties generally limit?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b58"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2148, "text": "the Court of Justice"}, {"answer_start": 2148, "text": "the Court of Justice"}, {"answer_start": 2148, "text": "the Court of Justice"}], "question": " What entity has taken the view that the goals of free trade are underpinned by the aims to improve people's well being?", "id": "5726b58f5951b619008f7b59"}]}, {"context": "Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non - discrimination. The EU manages imports from non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Fnciutoning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Qnavautttiie restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading reuls \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Osctch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against arapelll importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these idnhcanres to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has lsaw or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial porprety. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More alnelgrey, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although anmy companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1247, "text": "private actors"}, {"answer_start": 1247, "text": "private actors"}, {"answer_start": 1247, "text": "private actors"}], "question": "Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Commission v France"}, {"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Commission v France French"}, {"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Commission v France French"}], "question": "In which case were French vigilantes sabotaging shipments of Spanish Strawberries?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2394, "text": "a protest that blocked heavy traffic"}, {"answer_start": 2394, "text": "a protest"}, {"answer_start": 2394, "text": "a protest"}], "question": "In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria didn't infringe upon article 34 by failing to ban a what?", "id": "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc2"}]}, {"context": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a gertaer practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \" rncideit \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health udnre TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This uelr primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed iteaclr 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was neguoh to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" ahtt \" affects the access of that product to the market \".

In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to dinehr trade. The Court of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another member state are eesngki to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Uotsmmeknoundnnmabnes v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (juitslfibae under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \" the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate \" the market. In Konsanuntbmomdsmeunen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to local habits and customs \" to buy ehitr products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Nedur the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and etss out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum iledas of best practice.

Reflecting the economic nteura of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \" factor of production \". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \" social \" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had irhgts to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of eztiicns in TFEU ailscter 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a kerwor. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for veeoyrne ' s material dnees irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \" indirect quid pro quo \" for the work he did. Having \" rowrek \" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \" any person having the nationality of a Member State \" (TFEU article 20 (1) ), has rights to seek rkwo, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted hgirts to claim social security.

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a faoums case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean - Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R. F. C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could aforfd to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful nsleus they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to asepk Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design colegle could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Irsparmoi di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to eqruier Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" noriozhtal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigle v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel ' s claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \" closely linked to the socio - economic situation \" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full - time in Germany but was resident in Austria could.

Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Mstis v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this eritrscted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to dpivore services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical ssvricee abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Sdiae from public services, another sensitive field of services are those slaiisfced as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer rmof aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" rntentaniemet. The Court of Justice held that the German unnicstatiootl value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet. In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 373, "text": "because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice"}, {"answer_start": 381, "text": "Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice"}, {"answer_start": 381, "text": "Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice"}], "question": "Why was the Dutch lawyer who moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social society case told he couldn't continue?", "id": "5726c3da708984140094d0da"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2333, "text": "narcotic drugs"}, {"answer_start": 2333, "text": "narcotic drugs"}, {"answer_start": 2333, "text": "narcotic drugs"}], "question": "What did the Court of Justice reason were controlled in all member states in Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht?", "id": "5726c3da708984140094d0db"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1132, "text": "the treatment"}, {"answer_start": 1072, "text": "treatment"}, {"answer_start": 1072, "text": "treatment"}], "question": "What did the Dutch health authorities regard as unnecessary in Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds?", "id": "5726c3da708984140094d0dc"}]}, {"context": "In regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Alidy Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Rdemank ' s minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware tatratcs most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice elhd that a German court could not deny a Dutch building cpnaomy the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in ocilecltng taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" outright eogaitnn \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary.

A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e. g. , homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed eeivdnce congruent thwi the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are teehir sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e. g. , Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical onlamay caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and hatt Porifera (sponges) is the earliest - eigirgdnv animal phylum instead.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay esdo it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating atpries before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the eapkct network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - oriented features amed this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a uminmim set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link ptorocol. The simplicity of Rafme Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ASMB ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two.

The term \" Imperialism \" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \" imperialism \" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self - interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in aptrucilar exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extnnseoi of capitalism that rsoae from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that ietestnsaced colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural atreufe of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the tlae 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but feton lplaarel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.
